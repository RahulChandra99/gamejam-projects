# gamejam-projects

Collection of projects created during various game jams.

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of **small game prototypes** developed during game jams. 

## Projects

### 1. **Dodgeball**
   - A fast-paced arcade-style dodgeball game.
   - Features AI opponents and reflex-based mechanics.
   - Built using **Unity** and **C#**.
   - **Concept Learned:** Implemented AI behavior for moving targets and improved reaction-based mechanics.

### 2. **Tic Tac Toe**
   - Classic **Tic Tac Toe** game with a simple UI.
   - Includes **single-player (vs AI)** and **two-player** modes.
   - Implemented AI using **minimax algorithm**.
   - **[Play Demo @ Itch.io](https://rahul-chandra.itch.io/pixelated-tictactoe)** 
   - **Concept Learned:** Developed an **optimal AI opponent** using the **minimax algorithm**, ensuring unbeatable gameplay against the player.

### 3. **You VS Bot**
   - A strategic battle against an AI-controlled bot.
   - Focuses on decision-making and adaptive AI behavior.
   - Developed with **Unity** and **custom AI logic**.
   - **[Play Demo @ Itch.io](https://rahul-chandra.itch.io/youvsbot2)** 
   - **Concept Learned:** Implemented **adaptive AI behavior**, where the bot adjusts its strategy based on the player's actions.

### 4. **Maze Collapse**
   - A procedurally generated maze game with collapsing paths.
   - Players must **navigate quickly** before sections disappear.
   - Uses **procedural generation techniques** in Unity.
   - **[Play Demo @ Itch.io](https://rahul-chandra.itch.io/maze-collapse)** 
   - **Concept Learned:** Created a **procedural maze generation system** with a **dynamic collapsing mechanism** for time-based challenge gameplay.

## Technologies Used
- **Unity Engine** (C#) for game development.
